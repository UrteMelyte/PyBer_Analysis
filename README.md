# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to graph ride share data across a multitude of cities, to better glean trends and consumer behavior in urban, suburban, and rural regions.

## Results:

Total rides: Urban settings had 13x more rides than rural, but only 2.6x suburban.
Total drivers: Urban settings had 30.8x more drivers than rural, but only 4.9x suburban.
Total fares: Overall, total fares in urban settings were 9.2x more than rural, but only 2.0x suburban.
Average fare per ride: Fares per rider in rural settings were 1.41x more expensive than urban settings. Suburban settings were 1.26x more expensive than urban settings.
Average fare per driver: Fares per driver in rural settings were 3.341x more expensive than urban settings. Suburban settings were 2.38x more expensive than urban settings.
Total fare by city type: Fares differ more greatly in rural settings, and are generally more expensive. Urban settings are generally less expensive.

## Summary: 
To address the disparities among city types, we have the following recommendations:
- Provide more drivers in rural settings, which should lower overall fares
- Lower fares in rural and suburban settings would encourage more rides and increase total fares collected
- Create a "membership" program for lower population areas, to make it easier and cheaper for using PyBer
